My background in robotics and automation technology taught me a lot about machine learning and artificial intelligence. Regarding on my experience in quality assurance, I had managed a lot of data which consist of defect products data and the reliability test data. From that, I applied and performed the data science process which consist of problem understanding, data mining, data cleaning, data exploration, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and data visualization.</p>

<p align="center">Furthermore, my experience in rapid prototyping consists of CAD drafting, 3D printing, reverse engineering, micocontroller programming, PLC programming, wiring, and machining. I am a detail-oriented person with hunger of knowledge on learning new things and colloborate with others.</p>
